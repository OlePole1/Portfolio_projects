December was the best month for sales with a total of $4,613,443.34, while January was the worst month with $1,822,256.73.
Sales increased from January to April, declined from May to August, and increased again from September to December.
The cities with the highest total sales are San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City, likely due to their large population and proximity to ports and international trade.
Sales in each city may also be affected by local economic factors, seasonal trends, and regional consumer behavior.
Peak sales times occur at 12 p.m. and 7 p.m., so displaying advertisements shortly before these times may increase customer engagement.
AA and AAA batteries had the highest sales volume, while LG Dryer and LG Washing Machine had the smallest quantity ordered. MacBook Pro Laptop and ThinkPad Laptop had the highest prices.
There may be a possible relation between the sales of MacBook Pro Laptop and ThinkPad Laptop and the cities with the highest total sales, but further analysis is needed to determine if there is a correlation.
