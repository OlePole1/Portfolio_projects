# **Sales Analysis**
This project is a data analysis of sales data for a company that sells various products online. The data includes information such as the total sales, the best and worst months for sales, the cities with the highest total sales, and the products with the highest sales volume. The analysis aims to identify patterns and trends in the data, as well as provide insights that can be used to optimize marketing strategies and improve sales performance.

## Findings 
From the analysis of the data, it was found that the best month for sales was December, while the worst month for sales was January. There is a noticeable trend in sales throughout the year, with sales increasing from January to April, declining from May to August, and then increasing again from September to December. This trend could be influenced by factors such as seasonal changes or marketing campaigns.

The cities with the highest total sales were San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City. Total sales appear to be positively correlated with the population of the city and state. Additionally, the states with the highest total sales are all located on the coasts, indicating that proximity to ports and international trade may be important factors in generating high sales. Local economic factors, consumer preferences and spending habits, as well as seasonal trends and cultural differences, are likely to influence the total sales in each city.

The peak sales times were found to occur at 12 p.m. and 7 p.m. To increase the likelihood of customers seeing advertisements, they should be displayed shortly before the peak sales times. It may also be beneficial to conduct experiments to determine if displaying advertisements during non-peak hours results in higher sales or greater customer engagement.

The products with the highest sales volume were AA and AAA batteries, which were also the lowest-priced products. The products with the smallest quantity ordered were LG Dryer and LG Washing Machine, while the products with the highest price were MacBook Pro laptop and ThinkPad Laptop. There may be a possible relation between the sales of MacBook Pro Laptop and ThinkPad Laptop and the cities with the highest total sales, but further analysis is needed to determine if there is a correlation.
