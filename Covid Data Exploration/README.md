## **Dataset** ##
The Covid-19 dataset used in this project contains information on the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for different countries and regions. The dataset includes the following columns:

• Country/Region: the name of the country or region

• Confirmed: the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases

• Deaths: the total number of Covid-19 deaths

• Recovered: the total number of Covid-19 recoveries


## **Analysis** ##
The [**Portfolio Covid Query.sql**](https://github.com/OlePole1/Portfolio_projects/blob/main/Covid%20Data%20Exploration/Portfolio%20Covid%20Query.sql) notebook contains the code for analyzing the Covid-19 dataset. This BigQuery project analyzes COVID-19 data and explores various aspects of the pandemic, including total cases and deaths, infection rates, and vaccination rates. The code includes queries that calculate death percentages by country, infection rates compared to population, and total cases and deaths globally. Additionally, the project creates a view to store data for later visualization.

## **Findings** ##
The study found that the Covid-19 pandemic has affected different countries and regions in different ways. Some countries have been able to effectively control the spread of the virus and limit the number of cases, while others have experienced large outbreaks and significant numbers of deaths.

The study also found that there are differences in the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries between countries, which may be due to a variety of factors such as population density, healthcare infrastructure, and government policies.

Overall, the study highlights the importance of data analysis and visualization in understanding the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the need for continued efforts to control the spread of the virus and mitigate its effects.
