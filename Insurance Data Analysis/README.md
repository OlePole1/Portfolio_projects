# **Insurance Data Analysis** #

This project analyzes an insurance dataset using Python and the Seaborn library. The main goal is to explore the dataset and identify any potential relationships between the variables, particularly the "smoker" and "charges" variables.

## **Dataset** ##
The insurance dataset used in this project contains information on medical costs for different individuals. The dataset includes the following columns:

•	age: age of the individual

•	sex: gender of the individual (male or female)

•	bmi: body mass index of the individual

•	children: number of children the individual has

•	smoker: whether the individual is a smoker (yes or no)

•	region: the region where the individual lives (northeast, southeast, southwest, or northwest)

•	charges: medical charges for the individual

The dataset can be found in the [**insurance.csv**](https://github.com/OlePole1/Portfolio_projects/blob/main/Insurance%20Data%20Analysis/insurance-data.csv) file.

## **Analysis** ##
The [insurance_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/OlePole1/Portfolio_projects/blob/main/Insurance%20Data%20Analysis/Insurance%20project.ipynb) notebook contains the code for analyzing the dataset. The notebook first loads the dataset using the seaborn library and performs some initial exploration of the data, such as checking for missing values and calculating summary statistics.
The notebook then uses various seaborn functions to create visualizations of the data, such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots. These visualizations are used to identify any potential relationships between the variables, particularly the "smoker" and "charges" variables.
